# Neural Network in NumPy

This repository contains a simple **feedforward neural network** implemented from scratch using **NumPy**. It is intended to demonstrate how neural networks work under the hood without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Features
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: A basic neural network with one hidden layer, implemented using:
  - ReLU activation for the hidden layer
  - Softmax activation for the output layer
  - Cross-entropy loss
  - Backpropagation and gradient descent for training

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-numpy.git
cd ml-numpy
